Now i have learned a concept of branching.
Branches will help us to create a subranch where all the files present in the branch will also copy to subbranch.
Subbranches are mainly used wnen multiple people want to work on some work so they create subbranches and work on it
After that they commit changes to the main branch.
git branch -a list out all the Branches
git checkout subbranch_name will help us to switch for subbranch
git diff subbranchname show difference between main branch and subbranch
git merge subbranchname helps to find difference betweem main and sub Branches
git push origin main push the changes to main branch from subbranch
