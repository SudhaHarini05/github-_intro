Now i have learnt how to perform the changes made in local folder to reflect in the main repository. 
Here when we clone the git hub (git clone) repository in local folder two files will be created 
1.git copy folder 2.working folder now we need to first add files from working folder to staging area so that our changes will be added successfully (git add filename) 
now after adding the files into staging area we need move this file from staging area to git copy folder (git commit -m "text3.txt file added")
now we need to push the added code from git copy folder to actual github repository through this command (git push origin main)
github repo -> git clone
            ->working folder -> staging area ->git clone ->github repo
clone -> add -> commit -> push
